*TM-30-18* report prototypes
============================

The end goal is to implement *TM-30-18 Color Rendition Reports* in `Colour
<https://github.com/colour-science/colour>`_. For now I'm keeping the code
in a separate repository, until I figure everything out and come up with a
decent implementation.

For reference, a full report should look like this:

The standard specifies two more formats:
  * simple, with just the color vector graphic (CVG, the circley thing)
  * intermediate, with the CVG and the two local shift charts.
